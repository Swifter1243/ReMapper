# Welcome to ReMapper!

This is a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) library designed to help with making Beat Saber modcharts. It models the beatmap schema through wrapper classes and allows an easier, type safe scripting workflow.

It implements features from the base game as well as Aeroluna's Heck suite.

ReMapper was created from multiple goals:
- It was originally created to streamline the techniques developed during the creation of [Somewhere Out There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rphHsDxJbpg).
- I was tired of referencing a multitude of resources to figure out how to write/manipulate raw beatmap JSON.
- I wanted to avoid copy and pasting certain helper functions between projects.

Though it was mostly created for myself, ReMapper (and the code that derived it) has been used in a multitude of other projects.
